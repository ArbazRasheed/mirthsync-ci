[mirthSync](https://github.com/SagaHealthcareIT/mirthsync) is a command line
tool for synchronizing Mirth Connect code between servers by allowing you to
push or pull channels, code templates, configuration map and global scripts.

This repository contains an example of using mirthSync within the context of a
CI/CD workflow. 

Currently there is a Github actions workflow that demonstrates
how mirthSync can be used to push reviewed and approved code from development or
feature branches to a staging environment for testing. In the future, we will
add examples of workflows for Bitbucket, Jenkins, CodeBuild and more.
